# Computation of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space 
COMETS is a software platform for performing computer simulations of spatially structured microbial communities. It is based on stoichiometric modeling of the genome-scale metabolic network of individual microbial species using dynamic flux balance analysis, and on a discrete approximation of diffusion. COMETS is built and maintained by the [Daniel Segre Lab](http://www.bu.edu/segrelab) at Boston University.

COMETS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the MIT License for more details. 

Comets is developed with non-commercial use in mind and is presented as-is. To inquire about collaborations or commercial usage and development, please contact us at <comets@bu.edu>.

# Website
The COMETS website is [runcomets.org](https://www.runcomets.org/).

# Documentation
Documentation on how to install and use COMETS is found at [https://segrelab.github.io/comets-manual/](https://segrelab.github.io/comets-manual/).

# Installation
COMETS can be downloaded from [https://www.runcomets.org/get-started](https://www.runcomets.org/get-started).

# Toolboxes
We have developed both a Matlab and a python toolbox to interface the Comets software. How to use these toolboxes are described in the [documentation](https://segrelab.github.io/comets-manual/).
 - Matlab toolbox: [github.com/segrelab/comets-toolbox](https://github.com/segrelab/comets-toolbox)
 - Python toolbox: [github.com/segrelab/cometspy](https://github.com/segrelab/cometspy)
